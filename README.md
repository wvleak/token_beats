## Tech Stack
- Solidity / Hardhat
- Thirdweb
- Nextjs
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB
- IPFS
  
Contracts are deployed on Sepolia.

## ⚠️ Important Note:

Currently, it's not possible to add music and image files when selling beats, as the ipfs-http-client has been deprecated. I am actively exploring alternative solutions for this issue.
